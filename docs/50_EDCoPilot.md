# EDCoPilot Integration

We are excited to work with Razzafrag on integrating **COVAS:NEXT** with **EDCoPilot**!
For now, this integration allows you to view the AI's responses directly in EDCoPilot.
A second mode allows you to switch audio output between **COVAS:NEXT** and **EDCoPilot** and configure which of the two systems will COVAS:NEXT reactions.

## Key Features

### AI Responses in EDCoPilot
- This feature enables **COVAS:NEXT**'s AI responses to display directly within EDCoPilot, allowing users to interact with the AI through EDCoPilot's interface.
- Currently, responses are visual, but we plan to expand capabilities, allowing for deeper functional integration.

### EDCoPilot-Dominant Mode (New)
- **Overview**: The new **EDCoPilot-Dominant Mode** gives EDCoPilot control over audio output.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Disables COVAS:NEXT’s Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Prevents COVAS:NEXT from reading certain reactions out loud. Transfers the TTS functionality entirely to EDCoPilot.
  - **Overrides Specific COVAS:NEXT Reactions**: Certain audible responses and reactions typically generated by COVAS:NEXT are suppressed in this mode, ensuring that only EDCoPilot’s TTS is active. This helps prevent overlapping or redundant speech outputs and enhances overall coherence.

## Future Plans
We aim to expand this functionality in the future.
- **Further Integration**
  - Enable COVAS:NEXT to read and interact with EDCoPilot UI contents.
  - Add functionality to control the EDCoPilot UI using COVAS:NEXT commands.
