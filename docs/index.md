## Step 4: Obtain an OpenAI API Key

OpenAI likes changing their API key system, so documentation may be out of date. At the time of writing, you can get an API key using the following links:
1. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/ and sign up for an account.
2. Create an API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. 
3. You may need to charge your account with some money before you can use the API key.

## Step 5: Configure Your Profile

1. In the configuration UI, enter your commander name.
2. Next, enter your OpenAI API key.
3. We recommend using Push-to-Talk (PTT) for voice detection and setting the keybind accordingly (HOTAS, Controller or Keyboard supported).

<details>
<summary><strong>Common Issues</strong></summary>

- **Problem:** I don’t know what to enter as the commander name.
  
  - **Solution:** Use any name you prefer. This is how the AI will address you in the game and relate events inside the game to you.

- **Problem:** I don’t know how to obtain an API key.
  
  - **Solution:** Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to sign up and generate a key if you haven’t done so already. Note that you may need to add credits to your account to activate the API.
