# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the project! We appreciate your help and are happy to welcome you to the community. Our project is open-source and we are always looking for new contributors to help us improve the AI in any way you can â€“ and you don't even need to understand coding.

## Discord Support

The easiest way to help us it to be an active member of our community on Discord. You can help us by answering questions, providing feedback, or just keeping the spirit up. We are always looking for new ideas and suggestions, so feel free to share your thoughts with us.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it to us. You can do this by creating an issue on our GitHub page. Please provide as much information as possible, including the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. This will help us to identify and fix the bug as quickly as possible.

## Documentation

If you are good at writing, you can help us improve our documentation. We are always looking for new contributors to help us write new guides, tutorials, and other documentation. You can also help us by translating the documentation into other languages.
