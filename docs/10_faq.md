# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does this cost money?

Yes, the application uses the OpenAI API, which costs money based on usage. Typical usage costs are **around $0.10 per hour**, depending on your playstyle. Alternatives are [available](./advanced/freeSetup.md), but they will significantly degrade your experience and are not recommended.

## Do I need a microphone?

Yes, you will need a working microphone to interact with the AI and preferably a headset to prevent the AI from hearing itself.

## My antivirus software is flagging the application as a virus. What should I do?

Some antivirus software may flag the application as a virus due to **a false positive**. This can be very annoying and you may need to add an exception in your antivirus software or disable it, if you encounter this issue. All our source code is publicly available and our build process is available (and can be replicated) in the repository.
Please also report this to your antivirus software vendor as a false-positive, to hopefully get this resolved in the future.
After you have added an exception, you may need to re-download and re-extract the application, as the antivirus software might have quarantined or deleted important files.

## Do you support other languages than English?

Generally yes, but there are a few places that are currently english-only. The AI can understand and speak multiple languages, but due to some additionally process for numbers they might not be read correctly. Additionally, the AI tends to fall back to english sometimes, due to most of the game-events being in english. This can usually be fixed by reminding the AI of the language you want to use.

## I paid money for the OpenAI API, but the AI is still not working. What should I do?

OpenAI sometimes needs a few minutes to process your payment. If you are still having issues after a few minutes, please check your OpenAI account for any issues. If you are still having issues, please get in touch with us.
