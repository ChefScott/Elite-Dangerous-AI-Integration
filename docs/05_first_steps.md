# First Steps

If you have not already done so, you should first complete the [Getting Started](./index.md) guide. This guide will help you set up your AI and get you started with the basics.

Once you have completed the setup, you can start using the AI in-game. The AI can help you with a variety of tasks, such as navigating the galaxy map, managing your ship's systems, and providing information about the game world. The AI can also assist you in combat, mining, trading, and other activities.

There are several configuration options, that you can adjust to customize the AI to your liking.

## Character Prompt

The AI Character Prompt is a description of the AI's personality. You can modify this text to your liking â€“ if you want the AI to talk about your ships cat, you can mention "We have a cat on our ship that likes to get in the way of my controls when it wants attention.", causing the AI to role-play and mention the cats current whereabouts regularly. More examples can be found on our discord server.

## Audio

The integration uses your microphone for speech recognition. We support voice activation and push-to-talk (PTT). When using voice activation, we recommend using headphones to avoid the AI hearing itself, which causes a feedback loop.

## Event Trigger

Certain actions within the game can trigger events that the AI can respond to. For example, when the ship is in danger, the AI can be programmed to inform you. Depending on your preferences, you can choose to silence some of these events or have the AI respond to other events. The "Events Triggers" section of the settings allows you to configure which events the AI should respond to, making the AI more or less chatty.

## Keyboard Bindings
