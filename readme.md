This integration aims to provide a more intuitive and hands-free experience for commanders, making interactions with the game more seamless and efficient by allowing you to connect Elite:Dangerous with various services for Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech and Large Language Models. This creates a continuous conversation between you and the starship's computer via spoken word, as it should be in the 34th century.

The AI will react to game events, it will react to given commands not just in text but by emulating key presses or game actions. It can decide to take a screenshot or fetch information from Galnet or various APIs about topics, systems and their respective factions and stations.

The integration is designed for every commander: it's amazing at roleplaying, can replace third-party websites, can press buttons on command or if necessary provide tutorials and will always assist commanders no matter their role or level of experience.
